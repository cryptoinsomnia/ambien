          stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in

          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating

          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under the age of 13 years old, the Childrens Online Privacy Protection
          Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
          United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
          which spells out what operators of websites and online services must
          do to protect childrens privacy and safety online.

          <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
          privacy laws that protect personal information.

        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take

          </strong>
        </div>
        <div>We will notify you via email</div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <br />We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
          that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
          against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
          This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
          rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
          courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
          non-compliance by data processors.
